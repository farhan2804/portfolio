export const aboutText = `I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student, deeply engaged in the pursuit of a full-time degree. My commitment lies in harnessing my technical skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects and propel advancements in the domains of Electronics and Communications Engineering, complemented by Computer Science technologies. Proficiency in Java, JavaScript, and React JS constitutes a significant aspect of my skill set. I possess a robust foundation in PLC & SCADA and a comprehensive understanding of their applications in industrial automation. Furthermore, I hold a grasp of VLSI principles, encompassing digital logic design and proficiency in hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog and VHDL. My exposure to VLSI design tools, like Xilinx, further augments my capabilities. Within Java, I exhibit a solid grasp of core concepts, which extends to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and adeptness in data structures. This attitude has been applied to resolving Data Structures & Algorithms challenges on platforms like GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode. My proficiency in JavaScript covers advanced concepts and up-to-date comprehension of the latest ECMAScript standards and features (ES6+). I am actively honing my skills in React JS, focusing on constructing user interfaces. This endeavor includes the development of personal portfolios and acquainting myself with React component structures, all while cultivating the practice of composing clean and reusable React code.`;
